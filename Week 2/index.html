        <p>As a fine art student, there are many artist that have inspired me throughout my work and I refered to as references. Many who inspired me visual or/and conceptually. Fascination grows within when ever I come across more of Louise Bourgeois's work. Bourgeois's work is well known for its personal thematic content which involes the body, unconscious and sexual desire. The themes draw on events in her childhood which she concidered making art a therapeutic process. Bourgeois dealt with notion of univeral balance materails conventionally considered female or male. For example, she would use hard or rough materials associated strongly with masculinity as to using soft biomorphic forms suggestive of femininity.</p>
