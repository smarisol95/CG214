			<p>Stephanie Held is a 22 year old, fine artist born in Brooklyn, New York and raised in Staten Island, New York. I entered F.I.T in 2013 having no type of experience within the arts but self-taught methods. I've been teaching myself the arts since I was in elementary school and as I entered highschool, I majored in visual arts for my four years in high school and did not pay much attention or showed any care for it until I became a senior. I did not have the best relationship with my art mentor within highschool until I shaped myself up and realized how much I appreciated it. It drawn to me more and more as I matured and grew closer with ones who were as well interested.</p> <p>My first few semesters at F.I.T, I was flabbergasted of the amount of students who came from such artistic background. I felt as if everything I've started learning in college everyone else knew within their highschool, art programs etc. Regardless of this very small concern I had, I continued to grow and became more knownledgeable within this field. I am now finishing my bachelors in fine arts as a senior. As time is now passing by, it felt only yesterday that I've just walked in as a freshman. It's a bittersweet feeling in the sense of the amount of goals I have accomplish and the amount of colleague I've got to meet. </p></center>
