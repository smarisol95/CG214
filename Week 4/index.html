		<p>As I browser through the website <i>www.chromeexpierments.com</i>, I came across some fun and interesting website expierments that were created. As I was critizing each experiment, I came to one called <i>Through The Dark</i>. I'm not sure if the title itself caught my attention or the introduction image but this interactive film pushes the limit of mobile technology.</p> 
		
		<p>This film was written by Hilltop Hood's Pressure aka Dan Smith in dedication to his eight year old son Liam, who was diganosed with leukaemia. <i>Through The Dark</i> was written and rewritten during the six months Liam lived in the hospital. </p>
		
		<p>
			<i>Through The Dark</i> captures a world turned upside down in such way where 3D cameras mapped to the phones accelerometer. Being allowed to tilted and rotated to reveal a father and son's journey through two 3D animated worlds of dark and light.

		As you enter the page, the screen is black and white text pops up center screen reading the producers of the film that have collaborated together. Then fades out to another black screen introducing the title and a "begin"
button to start the film. As the page loads to 100%, it invites you to wear headphones for a better experience throughout the film. Then once the page has completed, it includes a white clean screen with text and aminiation of a mobile device being tilted back and forth as regulation in controling your experience.
